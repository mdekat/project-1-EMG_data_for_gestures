# project-1-EMG_data_for_gestures-master
## ML project using UCI database and concerning RandomForest Regression


Dataset can be found on: https://github.com/exelban/myo-armband-nn (thank you, exelban)

I used RandomForestClassifier to train a model that predicts the handgestures with the data generated by the MYO armband. 

The notebook file contains a main programm and a additional programm:



## Main:
0. importing libaries
1. loading data and prepping data
2. creating and compiling model
3. train model
4. evaluating model



## Additional:
5. randomsearch for the best parameters
6. evaluating model with the best parameters



## Extra:
Between step 5. and 6. another step can be implemented in which a gridsearch is preformed using the parameters that are found by the randomsearch.
