Since January 2019 I have completed several online Machine Learning and Deep Learning Courses (Coursera & Udemy). To improve my skilles I practices on a database I downloaded from the UCI website.

The link to the database I used is: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EMG+data+for+gestures
I trained a RandomForestClassifier to make predictions for the testset that was 25% of the original dataset.

Results:
There are 676565 predictions of 0 which is a fraction of 0.978773 of the total amount.
There are 58633 predictions of 1 which is a fraction of 0.972436 of the total amount.
There are 58590 predictions of 2 which is a fraction of 0.985169 of the total amount.
There are 60286 predictions of 3 which is a fraction of 0.985581 of the total amount.
There are 60430 predictions of 4 which is a fraction of 0.984266 of the total amount.
There are 60285 predictions of 5 which is a fraction of 0.987728 of the total amount.
There are 60706 predictions of 6 which is a fraction of 0.985311 of the total amount.
There are 3217 predictions of 7 which is a fraction of 0.996901 of the total amount.
